        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
        <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There,
        he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean
        Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics
        and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
        Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time,
        publishing over 800 different books and papers. His
        influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

        <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into
        mathematical analysis. Euler's work,
        &agrave; Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748),
        remained a standard textbook in the field for
        well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau,
        he wrote &agrave; Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772),
        giving a clear non-technical outline of the main
        physical theories of the time.</p>

        <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without
        copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such
        as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced
        in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783,
        leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and
        certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

        <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

        Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:

        <code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e^<sup>xi</sup>
        </code>

        which demonstrates the relationship between algebra,
        complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this
        equation, it's easy to derive the identity:

        <code>e^<sup>&pi;i</sup>i+1=0</code>

        which relates the fundamental constants:
        0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and i in a single beautiful and
        elegant statement. A poll of readers
        conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
        magazine named Euler's Identity as the
        most beautiful theorem in the history of
        mathematics.
